Pixel Paisan
============

Pixel Paisan is a combination of a pixel art painting tool and social image sharing site. The goal is to provide the functionality of a pixel-art focused paint tool, similar to many other paint programs, with the ability to easily save and share one's creations with a larger audience.

TECHNOLOGY
==========
Pixel Paisan is built on Ruby on Rails with Coffeescript, HAML, and SASS for the front end. With these, of course, come HTML5 and CSS3. Travis-ci and Heroku are used for continuous integration and hosting. User stories and project tracking are done at sprint.ly. Source control and versioning is done at Github.

WHERE
=====

Live builds of Pixel Paisan can be found at pixel-paisan.heroku.com. The github repo is at https://github.com/nbarnes/pixel_paisan.
